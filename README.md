# dephion_code_challange

- i choosed to use a MERN stack
- all services are containrized and if you use docker its gonna be really easy to setup and start the project
- i creates a simply Restfull api for backend, and definitly it could be scaled as a GraphQL service, who knows, maybe next steps :)
- i used joi in backend to validate data that comes and then parse it
- login would give you a token that wxpires in 30d, i could implement refresh token flow to be able to get fresh token for user but for sake of simplicity i used 30d limit on expiration

# steps

- .env files

- i could have other branches to manage stuff but i tried to take it simple
