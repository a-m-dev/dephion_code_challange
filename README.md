# dephion_code_challange

- i choosed to use a MERN stack
- all services are containrized and if you use docker its gonna be really easy to setup and start the project
- i creates a simply Restfull api for backend, and definitly it could be scaled as a GraphQL service, who knows, maybe next steps :)
